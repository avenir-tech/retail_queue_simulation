# Retail Queue Simulation

## Overview
A simulation that models the amount of time it takes for a certain amount of cashiers to serve a certain amount of customers in different queue systems. The single queue system has one line leading up to every cashier, and walking speed is accounted for. The multi queue system gives every cashier their own line, with minimal walking time spent.
